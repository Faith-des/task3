Hey, here is your new task! 
It is a TSV file containing 100 records.
 A TSV file is like a CSV file,
 but it uses a tab (`\t`) instead of a comma to separate items.
 The columns are city, date, and temperature (in Fahrenheit). 
 I would like you to add two more columns--weekday and temperature (celsius).
 
 So, if we take the first row as an example:
 Sunnyvale, CA 	2018-05-08 	56.3F
 (The date (2018-05-08) is in YYYY-MM-DD format so it is May 08, 2018.)
 It would become:Sunnyvale, CA 	2018-05-08 	56.3F	Tue 	13.5C
 
 I would like you to create two functions and use them in your program for:
 1) converting a date to a weekday, 
 and 
 2) converting from Fahrenheit to celsius.
 
 Functions are pretty easy. 
 It just allows us to collect code together for easy re-use later.
 Example function:
 def your_function(value): 
 # do stuff to value   
 # return value  
 return value
 Example  usage:
 value = 1234
 my_computed_value = your_function(value)
 
 You can either print all of the data (including your two new columns) 
 to the screen or create a new file.
